Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez is a thought-provoking and eye-opening book that explores the gender data gap and the resulting impact on women's lives. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the systemic bias that exists in our data-driven world. She begins by highlighting how data is collected, analyzed, and used in various aspects of our lives, from healthcare to transportation to workplace policies. She then illustrates how this data often excludes women or fails to consider gender differences, leading to a skewed understanding of reality.

For example:

  - Car seat belts were initially designed based on the average male body. This has led to women being 47% more likely to be seriously injured in a car accident than men, simply because the safety features are not designed with their bodies in mind.

 - While heart disease affects both men and women, much of the research on heart disease has been based on male subjects, and as a result, the symptoms and risk factors for women may be overlooked or misunderstood. Women are more likely to experience atypical symptoms of heart disease, such as fatigue, nausea, and back pain, rather than the classic symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. Because these symptoms are less well-known, women are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack.

I loved this book because it gave case study after case study illustrating how the gender data gap affects women globally. Often when I'm talking about institutional sexism, I don't have specific examples besides the classic ones that are always mentioned: the gender pay gap, lack of representation in leadership roles, sexual harassment and discrimination, etc. I loved reading this book and expanding my knowledge of how the gender data gap affects me and all of the women in my life. Criado-Perez also offers potential solutions throughout the book, which I appreciated. Instead of just throwing a bunch of information at us and then leaving, she suggested increasing diversity in data collection and analysis and ensuring that gender is always considered in policy decisions. I also appreciated that she highlighted the intersectionality of the gender data gap. She recognized that women's experiences are not monolithic and that the data gap affects women of different races, socioeconomic backgrounds, and sexual orientations differently.

One of the only things I didn't love about the book was that it provided a lot of anecdotal evidence and didn't provide a lot of in-depth analysis of the underlying causes of the gender data gap. I would have liked to read more about why we think the way we do, why it seems to have always been like that, and how that thinking affects our daily lives.
