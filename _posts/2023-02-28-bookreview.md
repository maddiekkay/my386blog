Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez is a thought-provoking and eye-opening book that explores the gender data gap and the resulting impact on women's lives. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the systemic bias that exists in our data-driven world. She begins by highlighting how data is collected, analyzed, and used in various aspects of our lives, from healthcare to transportation to workplace policies. She then illustrates how this data often excludes women or fails to consider gender differences, leading to a skewed understanding of reality.

For example:

  - Car seat belts were initially designed based on the average male body. This has led to women being 47% more likely to be seriously injured in a car accident than men, simply because the safety features are not designed with their bodies in mind.

 - While heart disease affects both men and women, much of the research on heart disease has been based on male subjects, and as a result, the symptoms and risk factors for women may be overlooked or misunderstood. Women are more likely to experience atypical symptoms of heart disease, such as fatigue, nausea, and back pain, rather than the classic symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. Because these symptoms are less well-known, women are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack.

I loved this book because it gave case study after case study illustrating how the gender data gap affects women globally. Often when I'm talking about institutional sexism, I don't have specific examples besides the classic ones that are always mentioned: the gender pay gap, lack of representation in leadership roles, sexual harassment and discrimination, etc. I loved reading this book and expanding my knowledge of how the gender data gap affects me and all of the women in my life. Criado-Perez also offers potential solutions throughout the book, which I appreciated. Instead of just throwing a bunch of information at us and then leaving, she suggested increasing diversity in data collection and analysis and ensuring that gender is always considered in policy decisions. I also appreciated that she highlighted the intersectionality of the gender data gap. She recognized that women's experiences are not monolithic and that the data gap affects women of different races, socioeconomic backgrounds, and sexual orientations differently.

One of the only things I didn't love about the book was that it provided a lot of anecdotal evidence and didn't provide a lot of in-depth analysis of the underlying causes of the gender data gap. I would have liked to read more about why we think the way we do, why it seems to have always been like that, and how that thinking affects us without our conscious knowledge.

The subject of gender bias is often a tough pill to swallow because it's likely that none of us think we are actively sexist. Even as I was reading the book, I thought, "but that's just the way it is! We say "man" when we mean both men and women because that's the way it's always been!" This book forced me to confront my own gender bias and all of the things that I have accepted without batting an eye. Everyone, regardless of gender, should consider reading this book. It can help everyone better understand how gender bias impacts our lives, and it challenges your assumptions and beliefs. Overall, we can become more informed and engaged citizens who care about the women all around us.

Final rating: 4.5 stars out of 5 stars

An extra and unnecessary example in case you weren't convinced that the gender data gap is literally all around us:

1. Getting the kids to school
   - Transport networks are designed to serve compulsory travel for economic activity -- not care, the reason why most women travel. The networks tend to be radial, great for getting in and out of town but not for traveling locally to drop off kids at school. Women do trip-chaining -- if there is no hopper fare, this means buying several tickets.

2. Arrival at work
   - The standard office temperature is based on the metabolic resting rate of the average 40-year-old, 155 lb man -- offices are, on average, 5Â° too cold for women. Personal protection equipment like lab coats and overalls are designed around the male body -- 10% of women in the energy sector wear equipment designed for women. The average smartphone is 5'5" -- too big for the average woman to use one-handed.

3. Paycheck
   - Women earn between 31% and 75% less than men over their lifetimes. They are more likely to be in part-time work, generally paid less. But we need the unpaid care work -- none of us, including businesses, could do without the invisible, unpaid work careers do. Pensions are increasingly directly based on past contributions, so women are penalized even further for their unpaid care work.

4. After-work work
   - Home again via school and shops, followed by unpaid work in the evening. Globally, women do three times the amount of unpaid care work men do. The failure to measure unpaid household services is the most significant gender data gap of all -- it could account for up to 50% of GDP in high-income countries. Cuts in social care budgets simply shift the cost from the public sector to women because the work still needs to be done. Of the cuts made in the UK following the 2008 financial crash, 86% fell on women.

5. An evening out
   - Automobile safety features are designed for the average male. As a result, a woman is 47% more likely to be seriously injured than a man in a car crash. Crash test dummies are based on the average male -- 1.77 meters tall (about 5'10") and weighing 76 kg (about 167 lbs).

6. At the theater
   - Why is public restroom space allocated 50/50? Women take 2.3 times longer, go more often, and often have children with them. In the developing world, the lack of public toilets means more than an inconvenience -- it causes health problems and puts women in danger. The UN says one in three women lack access to safe toilets. The typical Mumbai slum has six bathrooms for 8,000 women.
