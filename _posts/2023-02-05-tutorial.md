Picture this: you're sitting in class, and your professor brings up their computer's Terminal. Sure, you can open up the Terminal on your computer and copy the exact commands your professor executes, but what do they all mean? What does a cat have to do with viewing a file? Why are we so interested in CDs again? Aren't diseases terminal?

Well, my dear data science reader, that's where I come in. I'm here to teach you the ins and outs of navigating the Terminal. If it's basic, necessary, and applies to a Mac, you're going to learn it here. This is not a comprehensive list of everything you need to know to get started, but it'll be pretty darn close.

### Understanding the Terminal/Command Line

First, let's establish what the Terminal is. The Terminal is a command line interface for an operating system. It's usually used by network administrators and advanced technical users who want to initiate an action not supported by the operating system's graphical user interface. "No!" you might be yelling at me through your screen, "I'm not an advanced technical user! I love my GUI!" And I get that. But while it's not a necessary tool for the casual Mac user, it offers a surprising number of uses to simple minds like us, and it's worth learning the basics.

Think of it like whispering directly into your computer's ear instead of yelling at it from a distance -- it's a more immediate way of interacting with the system that provides you a lot of power. But with great power comes great responsibility, so let's learn what we're doing so we don't accidentally damage our machines.

### Getting Started

 The command line interface, or the language you type into Terminal to ineract with your Mac, is called bash. The commands we will discuss below are bash commands. To run a command, just type it at the cursor and hit return/enter to execute.

So, let's open the Terminal and get started!

Simple commands:

cd -- change directory
    cd ~ -- home directory
    cd [folder] -- change directory to [folder]
    cd - -- previous directory or folder you last browsed
    pwd -- show your working directory
    cd.. -- move up to the parent directory
    cd../.. -- move up two levels

ls -- display the name of files and subdirectories in the directory
    ls -a -- list all entries including those with . and ..
    ls -1 -- output the list of files in one entry per line format
    ls -la -- list detailed directory contents, including hidden files

mkdir -- make a new directory
    mkdir <dir> -- create a new folder name <dir>
    mkdir -p <dir>/<dir> -- create nested folders
    mkdir <dir1> <dir2> <dir3> -- create several folders at once

rm -- remove file or directory
    rmdir <dir> -- delete a folder (only works if the folder is empty)
    rm -R <dir> -- delete a folder and its contents
    rm <file> -- delete a file
    rm <file1> <file2> <file3> -- delete multiple files at the same time

mv
