Picture this: you're sitting in class and your professor brings up their computer's terminal. Sure, you can open up the terminal on your own computer and copy the exact commands that your professor executes, but what do they all mean? What does a cat have to do with viewing a file?

If it's basic, necessary, and applies to a mac, you're going to learn it here. This is not a comprehensive list of everything you need to know to get started, but it'll be pretty darn close.
